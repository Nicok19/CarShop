Header Component Documentation

Overview:
The Header component is a React functional component that provides a responsive navigation header. It uses state and effects to dynamically adjust its layout and behavior based on the browser window's width, specifically targeting mobile devices.

Details:

- **State Variables**:
  - `isMobile`: A boolean state that determines if the current device is considered mobile. It is true if the window's inner width is less than or equal to 768 pixels.
  - `menuOpen`: A boolean state that tracks whether the mobile navigation menu is open or closed.

- **useEffect Hook**:
  - Purpose: To add and clean up a resize event listener on the window object. This event listener adjusts the `isMobile` and `menuOpen` states based on the window's width.
  - Behavior:
    - On component mount, it adds a `resize` event listener that:
      - Updates `isMobile` to true if the window width is less than or equal to 768 pixels, otherwise false.
      - Sets `menuOpen` to false if the window width is greater than 768 pixels, ensuring the mobile menu is closed on non-mobile devices.
    - On component unmount, it removes the `resize` event listener to prevent memory leaks.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - The component is designed to be responsive, automatically adjusting its layout and functionality based on the browser's width.
  - The `isMobile` state enables the component to render different UI elements or styles conditionally, tailored for mobile or desktop views.
  - The `menuOpen` state allows for conditional rendering of a mobile navigation menu, which can be toggled based on user interaction and window resizing.

Usage:
- The Header component can be used in any React application that requires a responsive navigation header.
- It is particularly useful in single-page applications (SPAs) and websites that aim to provide a seamless user experience across various device sizes.

Example:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Header from './Header';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      {/* Other components */}
    </div>
  );
}
