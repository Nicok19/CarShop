Footer Component Documentation

Overview:
The Footer component is a React functional component designed to display a footer section on a web page. It includes conditional styling to adjust its position based on the current route of the application. The footer displays the creator's name, an API reference, and a brand logo.

Key Features:
- Dynamically adjusts its CSS class based on the current route, specifically adding a 'sticky-footer' class if the route includes "/dynamic".
- Displays static content including the creator's name, an API URL, and a brand logo image.

Implementation Details:
- **State Management**: Utilizes React's useState hook to manage the state `isDynamicRoute`, which indicates whether the current route is dynamic.
- **Effect Hook**: Uses React's useEffect hook to set the `isDynamicRoute` state based on the current window location. The effect runs once on component mount.
  - The `currentPath` variable holds the current window location pathname.
  - The `isDynamic` variable is a boolean indicating whether the current path includes "/dynamic".
  - The `setIsDynamicRoute` function updates the `isDynamicRoute` state based on the `isDynamic` variable.
- **Conditional Styling**: Applies the 'sticky-footer' class to the footer div if `isDynamicRoute` is true, adjusting the footer's position based on the route.
- **Static Content**: The footer displays the following static content:
  - A paragraph with the class `footerElements__author` showing the creator's name.
  - A paragraph with the class `footerElements__api` displaying an API URL.
  - An image element showing a brand logo with a specified source URL and alt text.

Usage:
- The Footer component is designed to be used across various pages of a web application to provide consistent footer content.
- Its dynamic styling feature makes it suitable for applications with both static and dynamic routes, allowing for flexible footer positioning.

Example Usage:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Footer from './Footer';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="appContainer">
      {/* Other components */}
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
}
