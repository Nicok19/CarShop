ProductDetail Component Documentation

Overview:
The ProductDetail component is a React functional component designed to fetch and display detailed information about a specific product in an online store. It utilizes React Router's `useParams` hook to retrieve the product slug from the URL, which is then used to fetch the product's details from an API.

Details:

- **State Variables**:
  - `product`: Holds the detailed information of the product fetched from the API. It is initially set to `null`.
  - `loading`: A boolean state that indicates whether the product data is being fetched. It is initially set to `true`.
  - `error`: Stores any error that occurs during the fetch operation. It is initially set to `null`.

- **useParams Hook**:
  - Purpose: To extract the `productSlug` parameter from the URL, which uniquely identifies the product to be displayed.

- **useEffect Hook**:
  - Behavior: On component mount, it defines and immediately invokes the `fetchProduct` asynchronous function.
  - `fetchProduct` Function:
    - Fetches the list of products from the API endpoint `https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/products`.
    - Parses the response to JSON and searches for the product that matches the `productSlug` from the URL.
    - If a matching product is found, it updates the `product` state with the product's details and sets `loading` to `false`.
    - If no matching product is found or if an error occurs during the fetch operation, it sets the `error` state accordingly.

Usage:
- The ProductDetail component is used to display detailed information about a product selected by the user. It is typically used in routes that include a product slug as a URL parameter.
- It is suitable for e-commerce websites or any application that requires displaying detailed information about a specific item from a list of items.

Example:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import ProductDetail from './ProductDetail';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Route path="/product/:productSlug" component={ProductDetail} />
    </Router>
  );
}
