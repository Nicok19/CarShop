ProductSkeleton Component Documentation

Overview:
The ProductSkeleton component is a React functional component designed to serve as a placeholder during the loading state of product information in a web application. It mimics the layout of a product card but without actual data, using styled div elements to represent the image, title, category, and price sections of a product card.

Key Features:
- Provides a visual cue to users that product data is being loaded, enhancing the user experience by reducing perceived loading times.
- Utilizes CSS classes to create skeleton shapes that approximate the size and position of the actual product data elements.
- Easily reusable and customizable to fit different product card layouts.

Implementation Details:
- The component consists of a main div with the class `skeletonProduct`, which acts as the container for the skeleton elements.
- Inside the main container, there are several div elements each representing different parts of a product card:
  - `categorySkeleton`: Mimics the category label of a product.
  - `imageSkeleton`: Represents the product image.
  - `productSkeleton`: Contains a `h3` element with the class `skeleton`, simulating the product title.
  - `priceDivSkeleton`: Acts as a placeholder for the product's price.
- The actual visual representation (e.g., the gray color, animation, etc.) is defined in the accompanying `ProductSkeleton.css` file, which is not detailed here but is crucial for the skeleton effect.

Usage:
- The ProductSkeleton component is used in web applications where product data is fetched from an API and there's a need to indicate to the user that data is currently being loaded.
- It can be placed in the UI where product cards are expected to appear, before the actual product data is fetched and rendered.

Example Usage:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ProductSkeleton from './ProductSkeleton';

function ProductList() {
  return (
    <div>
      {/* Assuming products are being fetched and we're waiting for the data */}
      <ProductSkeleton />
      <ProductSkeleton />
      {/* More <ProductSkeleton /> components as needed */}
    </div>
  );
}
