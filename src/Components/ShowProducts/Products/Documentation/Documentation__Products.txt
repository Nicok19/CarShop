Products Component Documentation

Overview:
The Products component is a React functional component designed to display a list of products in an online store or marketplace. It fetches product data from an API, handles loading states, and displays products in a user-friendly format.

Key Features:
- Fetches product data from a specified API endpoint.
- Manages loading state to provide feedback to the user while data is being fetched.
- Handles potential errors during the data fetching process and displays appropriate error messages.
- Renders a list of products, each product's information includes, but is not limited to, name, price, and image.

Implementation Details:
- The component uses React's useEffect hook to trigger the data fetching process when the component mounts.
- State management is handled via React's useState hook, maintaining states for the product list, loading status, and any errors encountered.
- A conditional rendering approach is used to display a loading indicator while data is being fetched, an error message if an error occurs, and the list of products once the data fetching is successful.
- Each product is rendered as a separate component, allowing for modular design and easy updates to the product presentation.

Usage:
- The Products component can be used in any React-based web application that requires displaying a list of products.
- It is suitable for e-commerce sites, product catalogs, and any application where product listing is a core feature.

Example Usage:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import Products from './Products';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Products />
    </div>
  );
}
