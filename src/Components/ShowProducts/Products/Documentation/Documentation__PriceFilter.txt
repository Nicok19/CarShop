PriceFilter Component Documentation

Overview:
The PriceFilter component is a React functional component designed to provide a user interface for filtering items based on a price range. It allows users to input minimum and maximum price values, which are then used to filter the items.

Details:

- **State Variables**:
  - `minPrice`: Holds the value of the minimum price input by the user. It is initially set to an empty string.
  - `maxPrice`: Holds the value of the maximum price input by the user. It is initially set to an empty string.

- **useEffect Hook**:
  - Purpose: To react to changes in the `minPrice` and `maxPrice` state variables and apply the price filter accordingly.
  - Behavior: Whenever `minPrice` or `maxPrice` changes, the effect callback function is executed. It converts the `minPrice` and `maxPrice` values from strings to floats (using `parseFloat`). If no value is entered by the user, `minPrice` defaults to `0` and `maxPrice` defaults to `Infinity`.
  - The `applyPriceFilter` function, received as a prop, is then called with the `min` and `max` values as arguments to apply the filter.

- **Rendering**:
  - The component renders two input fields for the user to enter the minimum and maximum prices. These inputs are of type `number` and have placeholders to indicate their purpose.
  - The `value` of each input is bound to the corresponding state variable (`minPrice` and `maxPrice`), and the `onChange` event updates these state variables with the input value.

Usage:
- The PriceFilter component is used in applications where items need to be filtered based on price range, such as e-commerce platforms.
- It should be placed in a part of the UI where filters are accessible to the user, typically alongside other filtering options.

Example:
```javascript
function App() {
  const applyPriceFilter = (min, max) => {
    // Logic to filter items based on price range
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <PriceFilter applyPriceFilter={applyPriceFilter} />
      {/* Other components */}
    </div>
  );
}
