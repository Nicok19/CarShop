Index.js File Overview

This file defines the main structure of a React application, including the `AppContent` and `App` components. It showcases the use of conditional rendering and React Router for managing the application's layout and navigation.

Key Components:

1. **AppContent Component**:
   - Purpose: Serves as a container for the main content of the application. It conditionally renders the `Footer` component based on whether the current page is the home page.
   - Implementation: Utilizes a boolean variable `isHomePage` to determine if the current route is the home page. If `isHomePage` is true, the `Footer` component is rendered.
   - Structure: The component returns a `div` element that wraps the conditional rendering of the `Footer` component.

2. **App Component**:
   - Purpose: Acts as the root component of the application. It wraps the entire application within an `AppProvider` and a `Router`, facilitating global state management and routing.
   - Implementation: The `App` component returns the `AppProvider` component wrapping the `Router`, which in turn wraps the `AppContent` component. This structure enables the application to use React Context for state management and React Router for navigation.
   - Usage: The `App` component is exported as the default export of the file, making it the entry point for the application.

Usage:
- The structure defined in this file is typical for React applications that require global state management and client-side routing.
- The conditional rendering of the `Footer` component within `AppContent` demonstrates a common pattern for displaying components based on the current route.
- The wrapping of the application's content within `AppProvider` and `Router` in the `App` component illustrates a standard approach to integrating context-based state management and routing in React applications.

Example Integration:
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './Index'; // Assuming this file is named Index.js

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
